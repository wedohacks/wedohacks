RXSS Leads to Account Takeover


Reflected Cross-Site Scripting (RXSS) is a type of security vulnerability where an attacker injects malicious scripts into content from a website that is then reflected back to the user's browser. If an attacker can exploit RXSS to leak internal IP addresses, and those addresses are indexed by a service like Shodan, it could potentially lead to more severe security issues, including account takeover.
